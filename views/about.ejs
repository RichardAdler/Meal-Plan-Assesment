      <h2>Our Story (Made up for my Assessment)</h2>
      <p>
        Meal Plan was founded in 2021 by a group of passionate food lovers and fitness enthusiasts who were tired of the hassle of planning their meals every day. After trying various meal planning apps and services, our founders realized that there was a significant gap in the market for a user-friendly, customizable, and affordable meal planning solution.
      </p>
      <p>
        They set out on a mission to create the ultimate meal planning platform that would cater to people with different dietary needs, lifestyles, and preferences. The result is Meal Plan, a one-stop solution for all your meal planning needs.
